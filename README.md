- 👋 Hi, I’m @eturner0020

- 👀 I’m interested in software and program development with a interest in cyber security and web development. I have three years of experience in
writing, testing, and debugging code, and have worked with small teams of students on various projects.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to better implement object-oriented programming, data structures, and algorithms to better improve the efficiency
of the programs that I develop. I have the most experience with C++, SQL, HTML, and CSS. I have some familiarity with Python, PHP, and Bash.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any types of projects that I can or someone else can think. Currently I am working on improving my HTML and CSS
skills by developing my personal webpage here on GitHub using GitHub Pages. I also recently began on writing different C++ programs using
OOP and different data structures such as vectors, lists, and arrays. I am making generic projects right now as I am simply trying to improve
those skills, but if anyone has a project in mind that they feel my skills can contribute to please feel free to reach out to me.

- 📫 I can be reached at my various social medias: Twitter = @eturner0020, Instagram = @evanjt20, GitHub = @eturner0020 or email = eturner0020@gmail.com.
Please feel free to get in touch if you want to talk or work together on any projects.
